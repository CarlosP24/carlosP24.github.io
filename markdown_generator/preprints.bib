  abstract = {Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The main caveats of this platform, however, are that the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps and that the MZMs typically coexist with a finite background of trivial subgap states. In order to overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs for the SM part of the full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that depends mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on neither electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry, nor on the strain at the interface, contrary to what happens in Ge/Si heterostructures where the strain plays a crucial role. As a result, core-shell hole-band NWs emerge as a promising candidate for full-shell Majorana physics, addressing several challenges in the field.},

  abstract = {We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.},
