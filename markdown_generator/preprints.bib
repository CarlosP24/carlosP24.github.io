  abstract = {Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The main caveats of this platform, however, are that the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps and that the MZMs typically coexist with a finite background of trivial subgap states. In order to overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs for the SM part of the full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that depends mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on neither electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry, nor on the strain at the interface, contrary to what happens in Ge/Si heterostructures where the strain plays a crucial role. As a result, core-shell hole-band NWs emerge as a promising candidate for full-shell Majorana physics, addressing several challenges in the field.},
