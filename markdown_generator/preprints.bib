  abstract = {We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.},

  abstract = {We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current \$I\_c\$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that \$I\_c\$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in \$I\_c\$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in \$I\_c\$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, \${\textbackslash}pi\$- and \${\textbackslash}phi\_0\$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number \$n\$ of \$2{\textbackslash}pi\$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii \$R\_1\$ and \$R\_2\$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers \$n\_1,n\_2\$ depending on the field. If \$n\_1{\textbackslash}neq n\_2\$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for \$n\_1=n\_2\$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.},
