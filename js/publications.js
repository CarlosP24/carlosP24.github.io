         "summary" : "We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\\pi$- and $\\phi$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.",

         "summary" : "We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.",

         "summary" : "We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\\pi$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.",

         "summary" : "Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps. In addition, the SM wavefunction spreads all across the section of the nanowire, leading typically to a finite background of trivial subgap states with which MZMs may coexist. To overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs as the SM part of a full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that emerges from the combination of the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction of the SM active shell and the confinement effects of the nanostructure, thus depending mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on red electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry. As a result, core-shell SM hole-band NWs are found to be a promising candidate to explore Majorana physics in full-hell hybrid devices, addressing several challenges in the field.",

         "summary" : "Majorana bound states (MBSs) located at the ends of a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire are only true zero modes if their characteristic localization length is much smaller than the nanowire length, $\\xi_M\\ll L$. Otherwise, their wave function overlap gives rise to a finite energy splitting that shows a characteristic oscillatory pattern $\\sim e^{-2L/\\xi_M}\\cos(k_F L)$ versus external parameters that modify the Fermi momentum $k_F$. Detecting such \"Majorana oscillations\", measurable through low-bias conductance, has been proposed as a strategy for Majorana detection in pristine nanowires. Here we discuss how this detection scheme does not work in full-shell hybrid nanowires, an alternative design to partial-shell nanowires in which a superconductor shell fully wraps the semiconductor core. Using microscopic models, we provide both numerical simulations for Al/InAs hybrids as well as analytical approximations in terms of general nanowire parameters. We find that Majorana oscillations with flux in full-shell nanowires are absent in a wide portion of parameter space. This absence is not a signature of non-overlapping left- and right-end MBSs, but a consequence of the Majorana oscillation period being systematically larger than the flux window of odd Little-Parks lobes where Majorana zero-energy peaks are predicted to appear. Our results demonstrate that split near-zero modes or individual zero-energy crossings should not be dismissed as trivial even if they are found not to oscillate with flux.",

         "summary" : "Full-shell nanowires have been proposed as an alternative nanowire design in the search of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). They are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconductor core fully covered by a thin superconductor shell and subject to a magnetic flux. In this work we critically examine this proposal, finding a very rich spectral phenomenology that combines the Little-Parks modulation of the parent-gap superconductor with flux, the presence of flux-dispersing Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analog subgap states, and the emergence of MZMs across finite flux intervals that depend on the transverse wavefunction profile of the charge density in the core section. Through microscopic simulations and analytical derivations, we study different regimes for the semiconductor core, ranging from the hollow-core approximation, to the tubular-core nanowire appropriate for a semiconductor tube with an insulating core, to the solid-core nanowire. We compute the phase diagrams for the different models in cylindrical nanowires and find that MZMs typically coexist with CdGM analogs at zero energy, rendering them gapless. However, we also find topologically protected parameter regions, or islands, with gapped MZMs. In this sense, the most promising candidate to obtain topologically protected MZMs in a full-shell geometry is the nanowire with a tubular-shaped core. Moving beyond pristine nanowires, we study the effect of mode mixing perturbations. Strikingly, mode mixing can act like a topological $p$-wave pairing between particle-hole Bogoliubov partners, and is therefore able to create new topologically protected MZMs in regions of the phase diagram that were originally trivial. As a result, the phase diagram is utterly transformed and exhibits protected MZMs in around half of the parameter space.",

         "summary" : "Full-shell nanowires are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconducting core encapsulated in an epitaxial superconducting shell. When subject to an external magnetic flux, they exhibit the Little-Parks (LP) phenomenon of flux-modulated superconductivity, an effect connected to the physics of Abrikosov vortex lines in type-II superconductors. We show theoretically that full-shell nanowires can host subgap states that are a variant of the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in vortices. These CdGM analogs are shell-induced Van Hove singularities in core subbands. We elucidate their structure, parameter dependence and behavior in tunneling spectroscopy through a series of models of growing complexity. Using microscopic numerical simulations, we show that CdGM analogs exhibit a characteristic skewness towards higher flux values inside non-zero LP lobes resulting from the interplay of three ingredients. First, the orbital coupling to the field shifts the energy of the CdGM analogs proportionally to the flux and to their generalized angular momentum. Second, CdGM analogs coalesce into degeneracy points at flux values for which their corresponding radial wavefunctions are threaded by an integer multiple of the flux quantum. And third, the average radii of all CdGM-analog wavefunctions inside the core are approximately equal and are controlled by the electrostatic band bending at the core/shell interface. As the average radius moves away from the interface, the degeneracy points shift towards larger fluxes from the center of the LP lobes, causing the skewness. This analysis provides a transparent interpretation of the nanowire spectrum that allows to extract microscopic information by measuring the number and skewness of CdGM analogs. Moreover, it allows to derive an efficient Hamiltonian of the full-shell nanowire in terms of a modified hollow-core model at the average radius.",
