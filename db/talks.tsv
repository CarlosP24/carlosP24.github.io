Quantum Designer 2025	Poster	Quantum Designer 2025	Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)	July 2025	San Sebastián, Spain	https://qd100.dipc.org/	This special edition of the workshop celebrates the Year of Quantum Science and Technology in the inspiring setting of San Sebastián. Participants will engage in discussions on recent advances in engineered quantum systems, from conventional and topological quantum phases to complex low-dimensional materials such as graphene-based structures. The program will also highlight progress in spin-based quantum computing, spintronics, and the exploration of topologically non-trivial states in hybrid superconducting systems.	https://carlosp24.github.io/files/Poster2025_04.pdf	Josephson effect in topological full-shell hybrid nanowires	refs-poster-Josephson
International Workshop on Superconductor Semiconductor Hybrids	Poster	IWSSH 2026	Institut Néel, CNRS	February 2026	Villard-de-Lans, France	https://iwssh.sciencesconf.org/	Hybrid devices based on superconducting and semiconducting materials are attracting increasing interest in the field of quantum circuits, due to their potential to replace more conventional tunnel Josephson junction-based components. One of their main advantages lies in the ability to tune the junction parameters via an electrostatic gate.Recently, significant results have been achieved, both in fundamental research (Josephson diode effect, chiral superconducting current) and in quantum applications (Josephson amplifiers based on graphene or two-dimensional electron gases, gate-tunable superconducting qubits).The goal of this workshop is to bring together international experts in hybrid devices, recognized for their scientific contributions and pedagogical quality, to present their findings in a way that is accessible to the scientific community.	https://carlosp24.github.io/files/Poster2026_02.pdf	Non-Hermitian Skin Effect and Electronic Nonlocal Transport	refs-NH-Rashba
