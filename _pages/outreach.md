## Superconductivity Outreach Team

Since September 2023, I am a member of the [Superconductivity outreach team](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/superconductividad/) at ICMM. The team is coordinated by María José Calderón and Leni Bascones. 

We carry out monthly superconductivity demonstrations for high-school students visiting our institute. More info about these visits [here](https://www.icmm.csic.es/index.php/en/actualidad-y-divulgacion/visitas-guiadas-al-icmm).

We also participate in scientific outreach events, such as the European Researchers Night, 11F, Semana de la Ciencia, etc.
