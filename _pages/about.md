Hi! I'm Carlos, currently a PhD Candidate working in the [Theroy of Quantum Materials and Solid State Quantum Technologies](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/) group at [Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM), CSIC](https://www.icmm.csic.es/), under the supervision of [Elsa Prada](https://elsaprada.github.io/) and [Ramón Aguado](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/people/ramon-aguado/).

My work focuses on the theoretical and simulational study of the realiztaion of topological superconductors with hybrid materials, specifically quasi-1D nanowires, and their potential applications in quantum computing.
Although my expertise is in theoretical and computational physics, I collaborate closely with several experimental groups by performing sophisticated numerical simulations.

You can reach me by email: [carlos.paya@csic.es](mailto:carlos.paya@csic.es).

## Highlights

Our latest preprint *Absence of Majorana oscillations in full-shell hybrid nanowires* is out at the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06330). Check out why we should not expect to measure the smoking gun of topological superconductivity in full-shell wires. 

A little summary, in this [X thread](https://x.com/cPaya_phys/status/1810978403425673437).
