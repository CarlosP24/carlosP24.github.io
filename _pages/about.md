Hi! I'm Carlos, currently a PhD Candidate working with the [Quantum Dynamics of Materials (QUDYMA)](https://sites.google.com/view/qudyma-icmm) and [Quantum Materials for Quantum Technologies (Q4Q)](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/) groups at [Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM), CSIC](https://www.icmm.csic.es/). My research is conducted under the supervision of [Elsa Prada](https://elsaprada.github.io/) and [Ramón Aguado](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/people/ramon-aguado/).

My work focuses on the theoretical and computational study of topological superconductors realized in hybrid materials, with a specific emphasis on quasi-1D nanowires and their potential applications in quantum computing. While my expertise lies in theoretical and computational physics, I actively collaborate with several experimental groups, providing sophisticated numerical simulations to support their research.

If you’d like to discuss my work or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me via email at [carlos.paya@csic.es](mailto:carlos.paya@csic.es).


## Highlights

Our theory of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon analogs in full-shell nanowires, published back in 2023 in [PRB](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.155423) has been demonstrated experimentally in our recent [PRL publication](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.206302). Read here Sole's excellent summary on this finding:

Check also our latest preprint, *Fluxoid Valve Effect in Full Shell Nanowire Josephson Junctions* in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16989) in which we propose a new type of supercurrent valve based on the different phase windings the full shell wires at each side of a Josephson can acquire; and our latest publication *Josephson Effect and Critical Currents in Trivial and Topological Full-Shell Hybrid Nanowires*, exploring the rich phenomenology of nanowire junctions in [PRB](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/8mzs-dx7h).
