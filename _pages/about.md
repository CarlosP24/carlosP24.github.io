Hi! I'm Carlos, currently a PhD Candidate working with the [Quantum Dynamics of Materials (QUDYMA)](https://sites.google.com/view/qudyma-icmm) [Quantum Materials for Quantum Technologies (Q4Q)](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/) groups at [Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM), CSIC](https://www.icmm.csic.es/). My research is conducted under the supervision of [Elsa Prada](https://elsaprada.github.io/) and [Ramón Aguado](https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/people/ramon-aguado/).

My work focuses on the theoretical and computational study of topological superconductors realized in hybrid materials, with a specific emphasis on quasi-1D nanowires and their potential applications in quantum computing. While my expertise lies in theoretical and computational physics, I actively collaborate with several experimental groups, providing sophisticated numerical simulations to support their research.

If you’d like to discuss my work or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me via email at [carlos.paya@csic.es](mailto:carlos.paya@csic.es).
